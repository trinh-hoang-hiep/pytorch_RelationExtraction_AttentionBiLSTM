Does this apply to President Trump too?"
7097321,This is malfeasance by the Administrator and the Board.  They are wasting our money!
7097322,"@Rmiller101 - Spoken like a true elitist. But look out bud. The re-awakening in Europe, Brexit and now the Trump victory are just the beginning. The unwashed masses are coming for you and your ilkâ€¦."
7097323,"Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of ""bias"" and ""prejudice"" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being ""intolerant"" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of ""irratonal antipathy"" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the ""bias"" question in another response to you....

It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum"
7097324,Sorry you missed high school. Eisenhower sent troops to Vietnam after the French withdrew in 1954 and before that America was providing 50% of the cost of that war. WWI & WWII were won by Democrat Presidents and the last win a Republican had was 1865  but the did surrender in Korea and Vietnam and fail to win in desert Storm or these two wars.
