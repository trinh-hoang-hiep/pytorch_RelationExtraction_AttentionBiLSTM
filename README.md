This is a framework for text classification by deep learning.


### Datasets
- Relation Extraction - Att-BiLSTM

```bash
python train.py -data_dir ~/proj/1908_prac_toxic/data/yelp/ \
-data_sizes 5 5 5 -batch_size 4 -verbose

```


### Step 1. Take a deep breath.

Do look into the data. At least read through 100 examples. Run python look_into_data.py.

- Understand the Input and Output.
- Find some signals for negative and positive samples.
- When programming, don't bother to look back at the data format again.

### Dataloading
```
preprocess.py
```

### Train and Tune
```bash

```
- Get some feeling of how the loss decreases
